Today, 1st Oct 2016, we add blog posts.

This is a **really basic** implementation, much more can be done here.

Next steps can be:

- Write a blog post on how to write blog posts
- Improve blog page design
- Write better css for blog post page
- Add metadata to blog posts (author name/author pic/date)
- Add related post section?
- Add support for rss?

This is all for today, time for me to enjoy the weekend ;).
